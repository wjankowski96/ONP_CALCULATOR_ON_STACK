Add first complex number: 3 4 (where 3 is real part, 4 is imaginary part) push Enter
Add next complex nuber: 0 7 (it mean that 0 is real part and 7 is imaginary part) push Enter
For example if you write only one number, it means this number is real part, and imaginary part doesn't exist.
If you wanna perform an action just type +, -, *, / and push Enter.
